Write your own getline function

Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call

You will need to use static variables

You are not allowed to use getline

You donâ€™t have to:

be able to move the cursor **Simple shell 0.2 +

You are not allowed to use strtok **Simple shell 0.4 +

handle arguments for the built-in exit

Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell **Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands

setenv

Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one

Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE

Should print something on stderr on failure

unsetenv

Remove an environment variable

Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE

Should print something on stderr on failure
